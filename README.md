# Auto-Review ReadTheDocs :call_me_hand:

Project developped to format ReadTheDocs Gitlab repos to fit with established nomenclature. [ReadTheDocs](https://<gitlab_url>/sdoppe/deploiements/docs-projets)

Each time this script is launched a new branch named `Auto-Review-<Date>_<time>` is created on remote repository.

This nomenclature documentation is readable [there](http://<doc_url>/fr/RTD/NomenclatureRTD).
This nomenclature has been restablished and released by Julien RAYNAL - AC75098488 - julien.raynal-externe@acoss.fr

## Scripts :pencil:

Environment is strongly advertise to be run in PyEnv.
```shell
python -m pip install --proxy <My Proxy Address> venv
python -m venv <My PyEnv>
```

### Bash :shell:
- [run.sh](./run.sh): Main bash script. It can be run with args or not. If no args, then run on all `hwi6_*` remote repos, else specify specific repos like `./run.sh hwi6_accrdv hwi6_odsmsg`
- [rm_branches.sh](./rm_branches.sh): Remove all `Auto-review-*` remote branches from specified repos
- [log_all.sh](./log_all.sh): Manage logs and tar them
- [auto-review.sh](./auto-review.sh): Manage Git local and remote commands && run auto-review Python Script

### Python :snake:
- [main.py](./main.py): Python script performing folder managment

### Others
- [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt): Contain all Python dependances
```shell
python -m pip --proxy <My Proxy Address> -r requirements.txt
```
- [prospector.yml](./.prospector.yml): Define prospector rules. [What is prospector ?](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/)
```shell
prospector <Folder>
```
- [.gitlab-ci.yml](./.gitlab-ci.yml): Define Gitlab CI/CD. [What is Gitlab CI/CD ?](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)

## Folder architecture :open_file_folder:

```
|-- src/
|   |-- templates/
|   |   |--  mkdocs.yml.j2  -> mkdocs.yml Jinja2 template
|-- __init__.py             -> Module initialisation file : define logger 
|-- arguments.py            -> Read program arguments
|-- checks.py               -> Check all problems, and resolves them
|-- compare.py              -> Compare YML for non regression
|-- constants.py            -> All constants needed
|-- files.py                -> File managment
|-- folders.py              -> Folder managment
|-- lot.py                  -> Lot managment
|-- override.py             -> Overrides methods to log 
|-- yaml.py                 -> Define YAML dumper
